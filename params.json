{"name":"rtVTK","tagline":"Ray Tracing Visualization Toolkit","body":"The Ray Tracing Visualization Toolkit (rtVTK) is a collection of programming and visualization tools supporting visual analysis of ray-based rendering algorithms. rtVTK leverages layered visualization within the spatial domain of computation, enabling investigators to explore the computational elements of any ray-based renderer. Renderers utilize a library for recording and processing ray state, and a configurable pipeline of loosely coupled components allows run-time control of the resulting visualization. rtVTK enhances tasks in development, education, and analysis by enabling users to interact with a visual representation of ray tracing computations.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
